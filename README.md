This is a Deep Learning Project on Face Detection and Recognition. It uses pre-trained face_recognition model. I have used globs and opencv libraries for images operations. It detects and recognizes the faces live using the device camera. It draws rectangle around the detected face. we must give the image path of the image folder having faces of people with their name in the image name. Whenever the camera detects the face of the known user, it displays the name of the person along with the rectangle. If not then it displays as unknown.
